LIS 570 is an introduction to the design of research projects, and the use of research methods to conduct evaluation in library and information science.

It's helpful to think of this course a *survey* of research and evaluation in LIS. Just as a *survey course* in literature or history is meant to give a general overview, so too is LIS 570 with respect to methods and evaluation.
