<p>LIS 570 is an introduction to the design of research projects, and the use of research methods to conduct evaluation in library and information science.</p>

<p>Throughout the quarter there are a number of important concepts we will pay attention to in that previous sentence - design, research projects, methods, etc. In some ways that sentence contains all of the things we will elaborate on, and investigate over the course of the next 10 weeks.</p>

<p>What the course will give you is the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>An understanding of conceptual foundations that underpin all social science research</li>
  <li>A working knowledge of how to design and implement research projects in LIS</li>
  <li>The ability to write research questions, and understand what their answers should contain</li>
  <li>The ability to critically evaluate research literature, and determine (given your own preferences and keen eye for evaluation) whether or not the results seem valid</li>
  <li>Apply technique in analyzing and interpreting existing data</li>
</ul>

<p>Itâ€™s helpful to think of LIS 570 as a <strong>survey</strong> of research and evaluation in LIS. Just as a literature or history survey course is meant to give a sweeping overview, so too is LIS 570 with respect to methods, assessment, and design.</p>

<p>What this course will not do:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Make you into an expert or even competent practitioner with any one method</li>
  <li>Give you a fully formed research paper that is ready for publication</li>
  <li>Guide you through a process of collecting and analyzing NEW data</li>
</ul>

<p>This course has very few deliverables, but it will require substantive work and time. One of the reasons that we design the MLIS curriculum such that you take a course like 570 early is that research and evaluation is central the practice of information professions - from librarianship to archivists to information officers  - each of these professional roles requires the mastery and use of empirical research methods.</p>

<p>The payoff will be worth it - many of your courses will be easier, your professional experiences will be richer, and your job prospects will be improved if you understand how to successfully design research and evaluation projects. This is not simply my opinion, you can consult the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Suggested Readings</code> below for an evidenced based argument about the value of research design for LIS practitioners.</p>

<p>In the rest of this chapter - rather than cheerlead about <em>why</em> research methods are worth your time and energy, I will instead focus on explaining <em>what</em> concepts underlie the course material and how we can productively get started with the quarter.</p>
